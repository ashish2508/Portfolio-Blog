# My Neovim Configuration

Welcome! This document outlines my personal Neovim setup. I've configured it to be a powerful and efficient development environment tailored to my needs. My primary goal with this setup is to get it up and running quickly unlike vsd.

The complete configuration can be found on GitHub: [My Github Repo](https://github.com/ashish2508/My-nvim) Do Star it

## Prerequisites

To use this configuration, you'll need:

- Neovim (preferably v0.10.0 or later, as `lazy.nvim` works best with recent versions).
- Git (for `lazy.nvim` to clone plugins).
- A Nerd Font installed and configured in your terminal for icons (e.g., Fira Code Nerd Font, JetBrainsMono Nerd Font).
- `ripgrep` (for Telescope live_grep).
- `fzf` (for Telescope find_files).

## Installation

1.  **Backup your existing Neovim configuration** (if any):
    ```bash
    mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
    mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak # Optional: backup shared data
    mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak # Optional: backup state data
    mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.bak           # Optional: backup cache
    ```
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ashish2508/My-nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```
3.  **Launch Neovim:**
    ```bash
    nvim
    ```
    `lazy.nvim` should automatically bootstrap itself and start installing the declared plugins. You might see a `lazy.nvim` UI. Press `I` (Shift+i) to install if it prompts, or it might do it automatically.

## File Structure Overview

My Neovim configuration is primarily written in Lua and organized within the `lua/` directory under a personal namespace `ashish/`:

- `init.lua`: The main entry point. It simply requires `ashish.lazy` to set up the plugin manager and plugins.
- `lua/ashish/`: Contains all my custom Lua modules.
  - `lazy.lua`: This is the heart of the plugin management, where `lazy.nvim` is configured and all plugins are declared.
  - `core/`:
    - `options.lua`: Global Neovim settings (`vim.opt`).
    - `keymaps.lua`: Custom keybindings.
  - `plugins/`: Contains individual configuration files for most plugins. These are `require`'d by `lazy.lua` in the plugin specifications.
    - `lsp/`: A sub-directory dedicated to LSP-related configurations (`init.lua` for general LSP, `handlers.lua` for custom handlers, `none-ls.lua` for formatters/linters).
    - _(Other files like `telescope.lua`, `treesitter.lua`, etc.)_

My `init.lua` is very concise:

```lua
--
 if vim.loader then
  vim.loader.enable()
end
_G.dd = function(...)
  require("util.debug").dump(...)
end
vim.print = _G.dd
require("ashish")
--
```

Plugin Management (Lazy.nvim)
I use Lazy.nvim for plugin management. It's fast, supports lazy-loading, and provides a nice interface for managing plugins.
The entire plugin setup is defined in lua/ashish/lazy_init.lua. Plugins are declared with their source, dependencies, configuration, and any lazy-loading rules.
Here's a snippet from lua/ashish/lazy_init.lua

```lua
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"
if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
  vim.fn.system({

    "git",
    "clone",

    "--filter=blob:none",
    "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
    "--branch=stable", -- latest stable release
    lazypath,
  })
end
vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)

require("lazy").setup(
-- First argument: plugins

  {
    { import = "ashish.plugins" },

    { import = "ashish.plugins.themes" },
  },
  -- Second argument: configuration
  {
    checker = {
      enabled = true,
      notify = false,
    },
    change_detection = { notify = false },
  }

)
```

Each plugin typically has its detailed configuration in a corresponding file under lua/ashish/plugins/

Keybindings
Custom keybindings are defined in lua/ashish/core/keymaps.lua. My leader key is `<Space>`.

## Learning Outcomes

This Configuration helped me understand lua syntax and basic understanding of its working within directories, the configuration itself isn't hard but willing to stop at one point is as there will always be a better theme, a better plugin, a better lsp, a whole better configuration but in the end all that matters is how much time you willing to waster on keep on configuring it
