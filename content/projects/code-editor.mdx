# My Code Editor: Your Next Online Playground!

Ever wished you had a slick online spot to quickly whip up some code, test ideas, or just play around without setting up a whole local environment? Well, meet **my Code Editor**!

This isn't just another text editor; it's a project I crafted to be a truly engaging online coding space. It shows off just how awesome modern web development can be.

## 🚀 Under the Hood: What Makes My Editor Tick?

Here’s the tech stack that powers this project:

### 🟦 TypeScript All the Way
The entire project is written in **TypeScript** – great for catching bugs early and keeping code clean and scalable.

### ⚡ Next.js Framework
Built using **Next.js**, leveraging features like:

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)  
- Static Site Generation (SSG)  
- API Routes  
- App Router structure  

Bootstrapped with `create-next-app` for a quick start.

### 🎨 TailwindCSS for Styling
Tailwind makes styling intuitive with utility-first classes that live right in the components.

### 🔐 Clerk Authentication
Authentication is handled by **Clerk**, simplifying secure user login and management.

### 📡 Real-Time Backend with Convex
**Convex** acts as the brain – handling all backend logic and syncing data in real time.

### 💻 Run Code with the Piston API
Code execution happens via the **Piston API**, allowing users to write and run code in multiple languages right from the browser.

## 🧱 A Glimpse into the Code: Next.js App Router in Action

This project embraces the latest **App Router** approach in Next.js (`app/page.tsx`, etc.). You get:

- React Server Components  
- Nested Layouts  
- Advanced Data Fetching  

All of which help create a smooth, scalable application.
